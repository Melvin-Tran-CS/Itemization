  <td><h2 style="color:black;">Early game</h2><br>
  <p style="color:black;">In early game,you only start with 500 gold,and once you get into that lane phase,you occasionally have around 1000-1500 gold when you have your first back.So the question is,how do you decide what items to start and what sub-items do you get when you first back?
  Well first off you must consider your lane opponent's strengths and weaknesses and how well you can far in lane.Second,you must think of what options do you have in your build that can allow you to financially able to get x amount of items in x amount of time.Finally,you must consider your team's strengths and weaknesses.If you can fufill all of these tips then please move on to the next paragraph.</p>
  </td>
  <td><h3 style="color:black;">Thinking ahead</h3><br>
  <p style="color:black;">If you want to take the early game item stage to the next level then I suggest taking a specific set of starting items when you begin the lane phase.For an example on Ekko I sometimes start with the normal doran ring and two potions,however after the first back if I have atleast 850 gold I buy corrupting potion and a dark seal.This is when I am snowballing the lane phase and utterly destroying my opponent.</p>

  <td><h2 style="color:black;">Mid Game</h2>
 <p style="color:black;">In mid game you should have atleast your first item and sub items for your second item.Depending on how well you did in lane,you might have your second and maybe even third item.In mid game,your options expand,and your choices become much more impactful.The possibilities of different items become larger as well.So how do you decide on what to build mid game and what do you think about after getting these items?Here you need to consider three things.One,are you behind or ahead.If you are behind you should consider your options more carefully and if you are ahead you should consider items that will help you end the game faster or help you snowball.Two,If you are required to solo carry or can work together with your team.In my long experience with playing solo queue,I have learned that you cannot always rely on your team at all to win.Sometimes you must solo carry your games to victory so I would only build items that I needed to win fights and not team oriented items such as locket of the iron solari or frozen heart.And three,you need to consider the state of the game.Sometimes if you are losing very hard early it might force your team to play very safe or force you to fight often and that leads to a question of what to build.Say you are playing support nami and your adc ezreal is getting dominated by the enemy jhin and brand.Your top lane darius is losing against a box box level riven player,and your jungle vi is getting invaded hard by lee sin,forcing her to farm more.However,your casseopeia just comletely stomped their zed and she took down both outer and inner mid lane turret.So you must think whether you should build frozen heart to combat their team or build zekes so that ezreal can atleast do a bit of damage in the fights.</p></td>

  <td><h2 style="color:black;">Late Game</h2>
  <p style="color:black;">In late game you should be close to full build or are full build.There is not that much to say about late game since all there is to it is simply adapting to what state you are in late game and what threats are there and what can you build to counter those threats.One thing you should do is,that you swap out items that provide less that you still have with items of more value.
  Another trick with late game is that depending on what champion you are playing,you can swap out items for underused or underpurchased items and surprise your opponents with it.Say you are playing nasus and your team has just barely won a teamfight and you and their caitlyn is left.You are very low on hp and she is full.You check that your tp is up and back to base.Quickly,you swap out two of your tank items with ohmwrecker and rightous glory.You tp to a ward and run into their base with homeguards and keep walking through the nexus tower and pop ohmwrecker to disable the tower and activate rightous glory to catch up to caitlyn and one shot her.Your minion wave comes up and you quickly kill the tower and end the game.</p>

  <td><h2 style="color:black;">Decision making</h2>
  <p style="color:black;">Learning how to improve decision making is alot like learning how to become a master chef.In league of legends,a vast majority of people do not konw the importance of decision making as it can affect the outcomes of your games greatly.In higher elos,sometimes the difference between a win and loss is which mid lane takes first blood,or which lane the jungler ganks first.In order for you to improve on your decision making you have to think about it like cooking.If your first dishes were bad,ask the people who ate them why and how does it taste bad.The same thing applies for league when you lose.You might not have people that tell you what you did wrong or how it was wrong,but if you keep track of every time you THINK you mess up and put every single action into account,yes every single mess up no matter how small it was,then you should be able to eventually improve even if it is just a little bit.</p>
